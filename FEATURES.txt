  - basic accounting reporing
  - stock items need to have a customer assigned to them, i.e. pair of shoes for warrenty.
  - export CSV of purchases (for marketing purposes)
  - ability to edit orders, after its complete - i.e. they wanted a chololate shake instead of vanilla
  - specify what products at what locations

  - FOB gate entry based on memberships
  - customer rewards & reward packages assigned to products
  - gift cards
  - grouping together multiple products - for example a school holiday program
    - e.g. 1x drink, 1x class
    - also regarding stock qty, it should deduct the qty on the day of the event
    - should also add to the bump screen any items that need making on the day of the event
  - marketing
  - ?lookup existing customer before completing waiver, might have bought coffee previously, but wants gym membership
